			<h2>Articles</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://medium.com/@skibinski.james/the-infinite-product-manager-a383d8ea23c3">The Infinite Product Manager</a>: my first Medium post about product management outlines how good product management practices align with the "infinite mindedness" that Simon Sinek advocates in <i>The Infinite Game</i>.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/the-single-transferable-vote-means-every-vote-counts-in-new-south-wales-local-elections/">The Single Transferable Vote means every vote counts in New South Wales' local elections</a>: in my final guest post for the Electoral Reform Society, I reflect on my experiences campaigning in a STV election and once again argue for the UK to adopt it for general elections.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/a-small-change-has-the-potential-to-make-a-big-difference-to-australian-elections/">A small change has the potential to make a big difference to Australian elections</a>: in my second guest post for the Electoral Reform Society, I argued in support of the Australian government's move to make preferences optional on the grounds of personal choice and genuine preferences.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/westminster-could-learn-a-lot-from-the-australian-capital-territory/">Westminster could learn a lot from the Australian Capital Territory</a>: in my first guest post for the Electoral Reform Society (UK), I argue that the UK should adopt the ACT's voting system for fairer and more representative elections.</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.taxpayers.org.au/opeds/why-australia-should-go-all-the-way-with-the-uk">Why Australia should go all the way with the UK</a>: in my first and currently only op-ed, I argue the case for Australia to pursue closer ties with the Canada, New Zealand, and of course the United Kingdom. I wrote this at the end of my time with the Australian Taxpayers' Alliance after Senator James Patterson and the Adam Smith Institute brought CANZUK to public attention.</li>

			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="./projects/avatar_quiz/avatar_quiz.html">Avatar Quiz</a>: a quiz that determines your Avatar bending. Quiz divised by Lucia Lobosvilla of Avatar Book 4 fan project.</li>
				<li><a href="./projects/land_tax/landtax.html">Stamp Duty and Land tax</a>: a tool that calculates for a given house price, how long it would take for land tax to overtake stamp duty, if stamp duty were abolished and replaced with a broad based land tax (based on 2020 rates and values). Originally written as an R Shiny dashboard for the Australian Taxpayers' Alliance.</li>
